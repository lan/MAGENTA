## Overview 
Studying genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is fundamental in understanding complex trait variations. Identifying genetic variants with GEI effects is challenging because the GEI analysis generally has low power. MAGENTA (Multi-trait Analysis of Gene-ENvironmenT-wide Association) is a powerful, robust, and computationally efficient method to test the interaction between a gene and environmental groups on multiple traits in large-scale datasets, such as the UK Biobank. More details about MAGENTA can be found in Luo et al (2022).

Specifically, `MAGENTA` package has functions to 

- compute the summary statistics with different types of data input adjusting for the potential overlapping samples under different assumption of genetic marginal effects; and 
- perform summary-statistics-based multi-trait analysis of gene-environment interaction (GEI) tests or genetic main effect and GEI joint effect for both common and rare variants.

## System Requirements

The package development version is tested on the following systems:

Mac OSX: Mojave version 10.14.6 (R version 3.6.0)  

Windows 10 (R version 3.6.1)

The CRAN package should be compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems.

## Installing Guide
`MAGENTA` package requires R with version 3.6.1 or higher, which can be downloaded and installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

```
install.packages("MAGENTA")
```

### Package dependencies

`MAGENTA` package depends on several R packages, which will be downloaded before installing `MAGENTA`. `MAGENTA` also uses non-exported R code from R packages `ACAT` and `SKAT`. The `MAGENTA` package functions with all packages in their  versions as they appear on `CRAN` or `github` on January 23, 2020 and October 28, 2021, respectively. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
MASS (>= 7.3-51.4),
Matrix (>= 1.2-17),
caret (>= 6.0-84),
stats,
utils,
gtools (>= 3.8.1),
SPAtest (>= 3.0.0),
survival (>= 3.2-3),
SimCorMultRes (>= 1.7.0),
SKAT (>= 1.3.2.1),
expm (>= 0.999-4),
CompQuadForm (>= 1.4.3),
caret (>=6.0-84)
```
